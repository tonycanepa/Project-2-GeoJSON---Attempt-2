# Project-2-GeoJSON---Attempt-2
Having trouble with first repository
Adding GeoJSON so it can initialize in GitHub
GeoJSON initialized in GitHub, having trouble referencing in the code to appear on my webpage. Trying to link just Hardship index, will wait a bit to test it as I know it can take some time to initialize. 
Was able to get GeoJSON to initialize on my page with the Community Areas, going to try to style this geoJson before adding another geoJson - uploaded new index.html with styling
